# Intro

I am currently a Computer Science sophomore at Nanyang Technological Univerisity, Singapore. Most recently, I worked on [Kyodo](https://www.kyodo.co.in/), where we were breaking down language barriers in coding by building a platform that empowers students to learn programming in their native languages. This platform has introduced over 900 students to the world of coding, making technology education more accessible and inclusive. Before Kyodo, I worked as a Research Assistant Intern at C3i Hub, IIT Kanpur, where I developed an asset management system to streamline and secure digital asset handling within the organization.

In my spare time, I have a quirky hobby of exploring random websites to evaluate their SEO performance, and I also enjoy editing projects as a creative outlet. [Here’s a look at one of my latest works](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAvSByUyJrc/?igsh=OXFuMnc5ZW5sYXk0).

# Some History

- The first software I remember using? MS Paint—where I created random scribbly masterpieces
- At around the age of 4 or 5, I decided to break open my computer to "see what was actually going on inside." (For some reason my parents did not find this as amusing as I did.)
- Fast forward to middle school at around 12 or 13—this was when things got real. I discovered Blender and watched an absurd number of tutorials, all to make a skull (but, unfortunately, the file has been lost to time (yes, tragic, I know)).
- Then I moved on to Unity and made a ball-rolling game, binging more tutorials.
- Around 14 or 15, my parents signed me up for skating and painting classes. Quite fun and a big stress buster actually!
- Then came the 16 to 18 era, the JEE Prep saga. For those who don’t know, JEE is the exam for getting into top Indian colleges, especially the IITs, and it requires a whole lot of studying.
- I ended up at NTU in Singapore—which, so far, has been one of the best decisions of my life.
- Somewhere around 17, I discovered anime (maybe my biggest time-sink after university).
- And here I am

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
